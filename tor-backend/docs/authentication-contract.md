# Authentication and Registration Contract

This document is the agreed boundary between the database/backend foundation and the teammate implementing authentication and its frontend.

## Registration Request

`POST /api/auth/register`

```json
{
  "firstName": "Somchai",
  "lastName": "Jaidee",
  "email": "somchai@example.com",
  "password": "user-entered password",
  "phone": null,
  "jobTitle": "Company Administrator",
  "company": {
    "mode": "create",
    "legalName": "TechBangkok Solutions Co., Ltd.",
    "displayName": "TechBangkok Solutions",
    "companySize": "25-50 Employees",
    "district": "Chatuchak"
  },
  "termsAccepted": true
}
```

When `company.mode` is `create`, the first user becomes `company_admin` and the company starts as `unverified`. Joining an existing company must use a valid company invitation token instead of accepting an arbitrary `companyId` from the browser.

The backend must normalize email addresses, hash the password, create the user with `pending_verification`, create an email-verification token, and record a registration audit event.

## Safe User Response

```json
{
  "id": "MongoDB ObjectId as a string",
  "email": "somchai@example.com",
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Somchai",
    "lastName": "Jaidee",
    "phone": null,
    "avatarUrl": null,
    "jobTitle": "Company Administrator"
  },
  "companyId": "MongoDB ObjectId as a string",
  "role": "company_admin",
  "status": "pending_verification",
  "emailVerifiedAt": null
}
```

Never return `passwordHash`, token hashes, failed-login counters, lock details, or database credentials to the frontend.

## Account States

| Current state | Event | New state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New registration | User record created | `pending_verification` |
| `pending_verification` | Email token accepted | `active` |
| `active` | Administrator temporarily blocks account | `suspended` |
| `suspended` | Administrator restores account | `active` |
| Any non-deleted state | Account permanently closed | `disabled` |

Company verification is independent of user status. A user may be active while their company remains `unverified` or `pending`.

## Roles

| Role | Intended permission |
| --- | --- |
| `company_admin` | Manage company profile, members, saved TORs, and company recommendations |
| `company_member` | View company recommendations and work with permitted TOR records |
| `project_manager` | Review companies, monitor ingestion, and manage operational data |
| `system_admin` | System configuration and emergency administration |

The frontend may hide unavailable actions, but Express must enforce every permission again on the server.

## Authentication Endpoints

| Method and path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/register` | Register user and create or join a company |
| `POST /api/auth/verify-email` | Consume an email-verification token |
| `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` | Replace the previous verification token |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | Verify credentials and create a session |
| `POST /api/auth/refresh` | Rotate the refresh session and access token |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | Revoke the current session and clear cookies |
| `POST /api/auth/logout-all` | Revoke every session belonging to the user |
| `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` | Create and email a password-reset token |
| `POST /api/auth/reset-password` | Change the password and revoke all sessions |
| `GET /api/auth/me` | Return the safe current-user response |

Forgot-password requests must return the same response whether the email exists or not.

## Recommended Token Policy

| Item | Lifetime | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access token | 15 minutes | Secure HTTP-only cookie |
| Refresh session | 7 days | Raw value in HTTP-only cookie; hash in `sessions` |
| Email-verification token | 24 hours | Raw value in email; hash in `auth_tokens` |
| Password-reset token | 30 minutes | Raw value in email; hash in `auth_tokens` |
| Company invitation | 72 hours | Raw value in email; hash in `auth_tokens` |

Use cookie names such as `tor_access` and `tor_refresh`, with `httpOnly`, `secure` in production, and `sameSite=lax`. Password reset, account suspension, account disabling, and password changes must revoke active sessions.

## Error Response

Every authentication error should use the shared API shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "EMAIL_ALREADY_REGISTERED",
    "message": "This email is already registered.",
    "requestId": "request tracking identifier"
  }
}
```

Expected codes include `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `ACCOUNT_LOCKED`, `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`, `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED`, `TOKEN_INVALID`, `TOKEN_EXPIRED`, and `FORBIDDEN`.

## Responsibility Split

### Database/backend foundation owner

- Atlas connection, validation rules, indexes, and collection design
- Shared Express configuration and database repositories
- TOR, company, recommendation, saved-TOR, and notification data access
- Database documentation, backup planning, and query performance

### Authentication teammate

- Request validation and password hashing
- Access-token creation and verification
- Refresh-token rotation using the session repository
- Verification, invitation, and password-reset email delivery
- Authentication controllers, middleware, and frontend forms
- Authentication tests

### Shared review

- Registration response and error messages
- Role permissions and status transitions
- Cookie names and frontend URL configuration
- Acceptance tests for registration, login, reset, logout, and suspended accounts
